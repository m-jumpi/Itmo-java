When using the flask run command with the reloader, the server will continue to run even if you introduce syntax errors or other initialization errors into the code. Accessing the site will show the interactive debugger for the error, rather than crashing the server. This feature is called “lazy loading”.

If a syntax error is already present when calling flask run, it will fail immediately and show the traceback rather than waiting until the site is accessed. This is intended to make errors more visible initially while still allowing the server to handle errors on reload.

To override this behavior and always fail immediately, even on reload, pass the --eager-loading option. To always keep the server running, even on the initial call, pass --lazy-loading
